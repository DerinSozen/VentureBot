# Requirements Document

## Introduction

VentureBots is an advanced multi-agent AI coaching platform designed to guide users through the complete entrepreneurship journey from idea generation to product development. The system leverages Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to orchestrate specialized AI agents that provide personalized coaching, real-time market intelligence, and comprehensive product development guidance. The platform integrates key technical concepts from BADM 350 and provides a modern conversational interface through Chainlit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an idea for validation THEN the system SHALL conduct real-time web search using Claude's capabilities within 30 seconds
2. WHEN market research is complete THEN the system SHALL analyze results using multi-dimensional scoring (market opportunity, competitive landscape, execution feasibility, innovation potential)
3. WHEN validation analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive visual dashboard with scores, competitor analysis, market gaps, trends, and strategic recommendations
4. WHEN web search fails or times out THEN the system SHALL provide fallback analysis with appropriate user messaging
5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL store results in memory and ask user if they want to proceed to product development

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a validated entrepreneur, I want to develop a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) so that I can have a clear roadmap for building my product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user proceeds to product development THEN the system SHALL create a PRD based on the validated idea
2. WHEN generating a PRD THEN the system SHALL include overview, target users, user stories, functional requirements, and success metrics
3. WHEN the PRD is created THEN the system SHALL store it in structured JSON format and display it in readable format to the user
4. WHEN PRD is presented THEN the system SHALL allow users to understand or refine any feature or section
5. WHEN PRD refinements are complete THEN the system SHALL offer to proceed to prompt engineering for no-code implementation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want AI-generated prompts for no-code app builders so that I can implement my product without extensive technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests prompt engineering THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive prompt up to 10,000 tokens for no-code platforms
2. WHEN generating prompts THEN the system SHALL focus on frontend-only functionality with responsive design and modern UI/UX
3. WHEN creating prompts THEN the system SHALL define all key screens, user flows, UI components, and technical specifications
4. WHEN prompts are generated THEN the system SHALL optimize them for platforms like Bolt.new and Lovable
5. WHEN prompts are complete THEN the system SHALL store them in memory and present them to the user for implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern conversational interface so that I can interact naturally with the AI coaching system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the platform THEN the system SHALL provide a Chainlit-based chat interface with streaming responses
2. WHEN AI agents respond THEN the system SHALL stream responses character by character for smooth user experience
3. WHEN users send messages THEN the system SHALL provide typing indicators and connection status feedback
4. WHEN sessions are active THEN the system SHALL persist chat history and allow session resumption
5. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent error handling and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a scalable multi-agent architecture so that the platform can handle multiple users and complex workflows efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize a FastAPI backend with Google ADK integration on configurable ports
2. WHEN agents are orchestrated THEN the manager agent SHALL coordinate between specialized sub-agents (onboarding, idea generation, validation, product management, prompt engineering)
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL handle memory management across agents with proper data persistence
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation
5. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL support Docker containerization with environment-based configuration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive market intelligence tools so that the validation process provides accurate and actionable insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL use advanced market analyzer with multi-dimensional scoring algorithms
2. WHEN generating market intelligence THEN the system SHALL extract competitor information, market gaps, trends, and barriers from web search results
3. WHEN creating dashboards THEN the system SHALL generate rich visual representations with progress bars, color coding, and structured insights
4. WHEN analysis confidence is low THEN the system SHALL indicate data quality limitations and provide appropriate disclaimers
5. WHEN market data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback scoring with transparent methodology
